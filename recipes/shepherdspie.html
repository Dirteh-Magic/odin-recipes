        <h3>This is a hearty English meal, made with lamb mince, hence the name! Although it is called a pie it doesn't use any pastry 
            and is so cheap, quick and easy to make, you'll enjoy making it! This is a 'larder cupboard' recipe, which means you can 
            substitute for whatever you have handy in the cupboard!
